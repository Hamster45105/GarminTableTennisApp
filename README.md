# Garmin Table Tennis Scoreboard

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the [Table Tennis Counter](https://github.com/sammenyb/GarminTableTennisApp) app with support for the devices I use.
>
> This app is mainly for my own personal use, so I am unlikely to add support for other devices/add new features. PRs are welcome but **please open an issue first before starting to work on any changes**.
