# Garmin Table Tennis Scoreboard

This is a hobby project designed for garmin watches to help you track scores, monitors serves and keeps count of sets.
The published app can be found at [Garmin Connect IQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/6fb68ada-3f60-4b7f-b7be-96cd20d74737)

## Controls

**Bottom button press**: Add to player 2 score
**Bottom button hold**: Undo last point/switch server
**Swipe right**: Exit app

The number of sets per match can be customised in the Connect IQ settings.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the [original project](https://github.com/sammenyb/GarminTableTennisApp) with support for the devices I need. I am unlikely to add support for new devices unless they have the same buttons/screen as the currently supported devices. I am also unlikely to add any new features.
